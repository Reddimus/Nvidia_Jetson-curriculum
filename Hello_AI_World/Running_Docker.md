# [Running the Docker Container](https://github.com/dusty-nv/jetson-inference/blob/master/docs/aux-docker.md)

We will continue with the Hello AI World repository and follow the [Running the Docker Container](https://github.com/dusty-nv/jetson-inference/blob/master/docs/aux-docker.md) guide to run some tests including:

- Launches the video-viewer application to view the video feed typically from a webcam.
- Uses the imagenet application to classify an image.
- Uses the detectnet application to detect and label multiple objects in an image.
