# [Running the Docker Container](https://github.com/dusty-nv/jetson-inference/blob/master/docs/aux-docker.md)

Docker is a way to navigate and run many of the pre-built models and applications in the Hello AI World repository. It simplifies dependency management and environment isolation. This is one of two ways to run projects and pre-built models in the Hello AI World repository. The other is to build from source.

We will continue with the Hello AI World repository and follow the [Running the Docker Container](https://github.com/dusty-nv/jetson-inference/blob/master/docs/aux-docker.md) guide to run some tests including:

## Launching the video viewer application

![video-viewer](./images/video-viewer.gif)

This allows us to test video feed from a webcam.

## Classify a jellyfish

![jellyfish](./images/jellyfish.jpg)
![classified-jellyfish](./images/classified-jellyfish.jpg)

Tests the imagenet application to classify an image.

## Detect objects in an image

![multiple-people](./images/multiple-people.jpg)
![detected-multiple-people](./images/detected-multiple-people.jpg)

Test the detectnet application to detect and label multiple objects in an image.
