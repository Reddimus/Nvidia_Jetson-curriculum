Welcome to the [Hello AI World](https://github.com/dusty-nv/jetson-inference) project! [This repository](https://github.com/dusty-nv/jetson-inference) demonstrates basic AI applications on the Nvidia Jetson platform. This is a comprehensive guide however we will focus on the key setup to make sure your Nvidia Jetson developer tools are working well.

## 1. Docker Setup

- Follow the [Running Docker Container](./Running_Docker.md) guide.
  - This setup will have you run 2 pre-built models including topics in:
    1. Image Classsification
    2. Object Detection
- Docker simplifies dependency management and environment isolation.

## 2. Building from Source

- Follow the [Building the Project from Source](./Building_Source.md) document.
  - This setup will have you run 3 pre-built models including topics in:
    1. Action Recognition
    2. Background Removal
    3. Monocular Depth with DepthNet
- Learn how to configure tools like Nvidia-specific TensorFlow and use CMake for C++ projects.
